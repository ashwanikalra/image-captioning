    "\n",

    "### Task #1\n",
    "\n",
    "Begin by setting the following variables:\n",
    "- `batch_size` - the batch size of each training batch.  It is the number of image-caption pairs used to amend the model weights in each training step. \n",
    "- `vocab_threshold` - the minimum word count threshold.  Note that a larger threshold will result in a smaller vocabulary, whereas a smaller threshold will include rarer words and result in a larger vocabulary.  \n",
    "- `vocab_from_file` - a Boolean that decides whether to load the vocabulary from file. \n",
    "- `embed_size` - the dimensionality of the image and word embeddings.  \n",
    "- `hidden_size` - the number of features in the hidden state of the RNN decoder.  \n",
    "- `num_epochs` - the number of epochs to train the model.  We recommend that you set `num_epochs=3`, but feel free to increase or decrease this number as you wish.  [This paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf) trained a captioning model on a single state-of-the-art GPU for 3 days, but you'll soon see that you can get reasonable results in a matter of a few hours!  (_But of course, if you want your model to compete with current research, you will have to train for much longer._)\n",
    "- `save_every` - determines how often to save the model weights.  We recommend that you set `save_every=1`, to save the model weights after each epoch.  This way, after the `i`th epoch, the encoder and decoder weights will be saved in the `models/` folder as `encoder-i.pkl` and `decoder-i.pkl`, respectively.\n",
    "- `print_every` - determines how often to print the batch loss to the Jupyter notebook while training.  Note that you **will not** observe a monotonic decrease in the loss function while training - this is perfectly fine and completely expected!  You are encouraged to keep this at its default value of `100` to avoid clogging the notebook, but feel free to change it.\n",
    "- `log_file` - the name of the text file containing - for every step - how the loss and perplexity evolved during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're not sure where to begin to set some of the values above, you can peruse [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf) and [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf) for useful guidance!  **To avoid spending too long on this notebook**, you are encouraged to consult these suggested research papers to obtain a strong initial guess for which hyperparameters are likely to work best.  Then, train a single model, and proceed to the next notebook (**3_Inference.ipynb**).  If you are unhappy with your performance, you can return to this notebook to tweak the hyperparameters (and/or the architecture in **model.py**) and re-train your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** Describe your CNN-RNN architecture in detail.  With this architecture in mind, how did you select the values of the variables in Task 1?  If you consulted a research paper detailing a successful implementation of an image captioning model, please provide the reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** \n",
    "Following Architecture was used\n",
    "1. Pretrained CNN Network ResNet-50 without FC layer which outputs feature vector of embed_size.\n",
    "2. The output from the previous CNN network and processed captions are fed to the embedded layer.\n",
    "3. The combined input is then passed to the LSTM layer of size 1 to output the next word.\n",
    "\n",
    "Went through the research papers suggested above in this notebook. And also the video about Hyperparameters.\n",
    "- The most important parameters are learning rate and batch size. The first paper \"Neural Image Caption Generation with Visual Attention\" mentioned batch size of 64 and Adam optimizer performed best for COCO dataset. I tried batch sizes of 64 and 128 Increasing the batch size slowed down the training as more examples were fed as input to the network. Noticed slightly better result with batch size of 128. But that was the observation coming from just 2-3 epochs.\n",
    "- Learning rate combinations that I tried (batch size 64, LR=0.01), (batch size 128, LR=0.001). I think 0.1 might result in overshooting, so I started with these combinations and finalized with batch size 128 and LR=0.001.\n",
    "- Kept only one layer in the LSTM network. Increasing the layers of the LSTM network would have yielded better fitting. Used dropout of 0.5 to prevent overfitting.\n",
    "- It is very important to select the parameters which have a large impact so that training time can be reduced. Only if further accuracy is required based on the business tolerance can we look at other parameters like no. of layers or no. of cells in a layer\n",
    "- Rest of the parameters like embed_size, hidden_size, vocab_threshold were not changed as they were not going to have a big  impact on accuracy for this exercise. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### (Optional) Task #2\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we have provided a recommended image transform `transform_train` for pre-processing the training images, but you are welcome (and encouraged!) to modify it as you wish.  When modifying this transform, keep in mind that:\n",
    "- the images in the dataset have varying heights and widths, and \n",
    "- if using a pre-trained model, you must perform the corresponding appropriate normalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the transform in `transform_train`?  If you left the transform at its provided value, why do you think that it is a good choice for your CNN architecture?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** \n",
    "I left the transform as it is because I think that it is doing all the required pre-processing which will help in efficient training, For Example:\n",
    "1. It is cropping the image of different input sizes to standard fixed size\n",
    "2. It is normalizing the image so as to have values in a particular range which helps in the gradient converge early.  \n",
    "3. It is doing a horizontal flip of the images so that it can predict the caption with the same consistency.\n",
    "4. It is converting images into tensor which is required be framework. \n",
    "\n",
    "If I would use my modified transform, I might use additional steps like rotating, reducing the resolution etc. so that the network can handle all kinds of images and predict the captions with good accuracy. This is called augmentation which can also help generate more inputs in case we are not able to procure sufficient images. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Task #3\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you will specify a Python list containing the learnable parameters of the model.  For instance, if you decide to make all weights in the decoder trainable, but only want to train the weights in the embedding layer of the encoder, then you should set `params` to something like:\n",
    "```\n",
    "params = list(decoder.parameters()) + list(encoder.embed.parameters()) \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the trainable parameters of your architecture?  Why do you think this is a good choice?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** \n",
    "- Since CNN ResNet-50 network is pretrained, those parameters are not needed to be updated/trained again. Only if I see that it is not fitting for my dataset, then I may have to train other parameters also by training on COCO dataset. Transfer learning is working well for this network. Only embedding layer parameters are used as trainable parameters because that is specific to our scenario and were not trained as a part of ResNet-50 network. \n",
    "- All the parameters for decoder network needs to be trained as that is not pretrained to be used in general. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Task #4\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you will select an [optimizer](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/optim.html#torch.optim.Optimizer).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the optimizer used to train your model?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** \n",
    "Adam optimizer generally works well for many scenarios as it combines the features of both RMSProp and Momentum. One of the paper mentioned above https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf observed in section 4.3 that for them Adam worked better on COCO dataset. "

For now, we strongly encourage you to train your model for the suggested 3 epochs without worrying about performance; then, you should immediately transition to the next notebook in the sequence (**3_Inference.ipynb**) to see how your model performs on the test data.  If your model needs to be changed, you can come back to this notebook, amend hyperparameters (if necessary), and re-train the model.\n",

In the next (optional) step of this notebook, we provide some guidance for assessing the performance on the validation dataset."

    "To assess potential overfitting, one approach is to assess performance on a validation set.  If you decide to do this **optional** task, you are required to first complete all of the steps in the next notebook in the sequence (**3_Inference.ipynb**); as part of that notebook, you will write and test code (specifically, the `sample` method in the `DecoderRNN` class) that uses your RNN decoder to generate captions.  That code will prove incredibly useful here. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you decide to validate your model, please do not edit the data loader in **data_loader.py**.  Instead, create a new file named **data_loader_val.py** containing the code for obtaining the data loader for the validation data.  You can access:\n",
    "- the validation images at filepath `'/opt/cocoapi/images/train2014/'`, and\n",
    "- the validation image caption annotation file at filepath `'/opt/cocoapi/annotations/captions_val2014.json'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The suggested approach to validating your model involves creating a json file such as [this one](https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi/blob/master/results/captions_val2014_fakecap_results.json) containing your model's predicted captions for the validation images.  Then, you can write your own script or use one that you [find online](https://github.com/tylin/coco-caption) to calculate the BLEU score of your model.  You can read more about the BLEU score, along with other evaluation metrics (such as TEOR and Cider) in section 4.1 of [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf).  For more information about how to use the annotation file, check out the [website](http://cocodataset.org/#download) for the COCO dataset."
